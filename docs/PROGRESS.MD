# Phase 0 Progress Report

## Summary

Phase 0 of Project Aura is complete. The goal was to establish a secure, reliable, and permanent communication channel with Gmail using OAuth 2.0, as outlined in the project plan. This was achieved by implementing and testing the `auth_setup.py` script.

## What Was Done

- Created `auth_setup.py` to handle Gmail OAuth 2.0 authentication using the provided `credentials.json`.
- The script checks for the latest unread email, sends an automated reply, and deletes the original email.
- The script saves and refreshes tokens in `token.json` for seamless future runs.
- The Gmail API scope was set to full access (`https://mail.google.com/`) to allow all required operations, including deleting emails.
- The script was tested successfully: it authenticated, processed an email, replied, and deleted the original message without manual intervention.

## Go/No-Go Checkpoint

- âœ… User confirmed: The script works as intended. Authentication, reply, and deletion all function correctly.

## Next Steps

- Proceed to Phase 1: Implement the Local Brain (Triage Router & Executor) as described in the project plan.
