Leveraging Vertex AI Function Calling for Structured JSON Responses from Large Language Models1. Introduction to Vertex AI Function Calling for Structured DataLarge Language Models (LLMs) possess remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. However, to interact effectively with external systems or provide responses grounded in real-time, specific data, they require mechanisms to produce structured output. Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform offers a powerful feature known as "function calling" (also referred to as tool use) that enables LLMs, particularly the Gemini family of models, to generate structured JSON objects based on user prompts and predefined function schemas.1 This capability is pivotal for developers seeking to integrate LLMs into workflows that necessitate predictable, machine-readable data formats.Function calling does not mean the LLM directly executes external code. Instead, when presented with a user's query and a set of available "tools" (defined functions), the model can determine if invoking one of these tools would help in formulating a response. If it decides a tool is appropriate, the LLM outputs a structured JSON object specifying the name of the function to be called and the arguments it deems necessary for that function, extracted and inferred from the user's prompt.1 This JSON output itself can be the desired structured data. Alternatively, the application can then execute the specified function with the provided arguments, feed the result back to the LLM, and receive a more informed, contextual natural language response.This report provides a comprehensive overview of how to utilize the Vertex AI API, focusing on the Python SDK, to configure and prompt an LLM to respond with structured JSON. It will detail the core components, a step-by-step implementation guide, strategies for ensuring robust JSON output, advanced techniques, and best practices. The primary goal is to equip developers with the knowledge to reliably extract structured data from LLM interactions.2. Core Components of Vertex AI Function CallingTo effectively use function calling for structured JSON output, understanding its fundamental components is essential. These components work in concert to define the capabilities offered to the LLM and to process its responses.

FunctionDeclaration: This is the cornerstone for defining a tool that the LLM can "call." It describes the function's name, its purpose, and, most importantly for structured JSON output, the schema of its parameters.2 The parameters schema, defined using a format compatible with the OpenAPI 3.0 specification, dictates the structure of the JSON object the LLM will attempt to generate as arguments for the function.1 Key attributes within a FunctionDeclaration include:

name: A unique identifier for the function. It must start with a letter or underscore and can contain letters, numbers, underscores, dots, or dashes, with a maximum length of 64 characters.2
description: A natural language explanation of what the function does. This is crucial as the LLM uses this description to decide when and how to use the function.1
parameters: An object defining the schema for the function's input arguments. This schema specifies the expected data types (e.g., STRING, INTEGER, OBJECT, ARRAY), properties, and whether fields are required.2 The structure of this schema directly maps to the desired JSON output.



Tool: A Tool object acts as a container for one or more FunctionDeclaration instances.4 When making a request to the LLM, a list of Tool objects is provided, making the declared functions available for the model to consider.1


FunctionCallingConfig: This configuration object allows developers to control how the LLM utilizes the provided tools.2 It is particularly important for ensuring JSON output. Its primary attribute is mode, which can be set to one of the following values:


ModeDescriptionSnippet ReferenceAUTO(Default) The model decides whether to predict a function call or generate a natural language response based on the context.1ANYThe model is constrained to always predict a function call. If allowed_function_names is not provided, the model can pick from any of the available function declarations. This mode is key for forcing JSON output.1NONEThe model is prevented from predicting any function calls, effectively behaving as if no tools were provided.1
The `FunctionCallingConfig` can also include `allowed_function_names`, a list of specific function names the model is restricted to choose from when `mode` is `ANY`.[2]


functionCall (Model Output): When the LLM decides to "call" a function, its response will contain a functionCall part. This is not an actual execution but a structured JSON object itself, containing 2:

name: The name of the function the model suggests calling (matching one of the provided FunctionDeclaration names).
args: A JSON object (or struct) containing the arguments for the function, structured according to the parameters schema defined in the corresponding FunctionDeclaration. This args field is the structured JSON output that is the primary focus of this report.



functionResponse (Input to Model): If the application proceeds to execute the actual external function based on the model's functionCall suggestion, the result of that execution is packaged into a functionResponse object and sent back to the model in a subsequent turn. This object includes 2:

name: The name of the function that was executed.
response: A JSON object containing the output/result from the executed function.
The model then uses this information to generate a final, more informed natural language response.1 However, if the sole objective is to obtain the structured JSON from functionCall.args, this step might be optional.


These components provide a flexible framework for guiding the LLM to generate structured data, bridging the gap between natural language understanding and the structured data requirements of applications.3. Step-by-Step Guide: Obtaining Structured JSON via Function CallingThis section details the practical steps to configure and use the Vertex AI API with the Python SDK to elicit structured JSON responses from an LLM.3.1. Initializing the Vertex AI SDK and ModelBefore interacting with the LLM, the Vertex AI SDK must be initialized with the Google Cloud project ID and location. A generative model instance, typically from the Gemini family (e.g., "gemini-1.0-pro", "gemini-1.5-flash"), needs to be created. Many Gemini models support function calling.2Python# (Illustrative Python for SDK setup)
import vertexai
from vertexai.generative_models import GenerativeModel, FunctionDeclaration, Tool, Part

# Define project information
PROJECT_ID = "your-project-id"  # Replace with your project ID
LOCATION = "us-central1"      # Replace with your region

# Initialize Vertex AI SDK
vertexai.init(project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION)

# Load a compatible model
# Ensure the chosen model supports function calling (e.g., Gemini models)
model = GenerativeModel("gemini-1.0-pro") # Or other compatible models like "gemini-1.5-flash"
This foundational setup is standard for most Vertex AI interactions.43.2. Defining the FunctionDeclaration with a Parameter SchemaThe core of obtaining structured JSON lies in meticulously defining the FunctionDeclaration, especially its parameters schema. This schema acts as the template for the JSON output the LLM will generate. The schema must conform to a subset of the OpenAPI 3.0 specification.1Consider an example where the goal is to extract movie details (title, release year, and main actors) from a user's query. The FunctionDeclaration would define this structure:Python# (Illustrative Python dictionary for schema)
movie_info_func = FunctionDeclaration(
    name="get_movie_details",
    description="Extracts movie title, release year, and main actors from a user query. Use the current year if the release year is not specified.",
    parameters={
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "movie_title": {"type": "string", "description": "The title of the movie, e.g., 'Inception'"},
            "release_year": {"type": "integer", "description": "The year the movie was released, e.g., 2010"},
            "actors": {
                "type": "array",
                "items": {"type": "string"},
                "description": "A list of main actors in the movie, e.g.,"
            }
        },
        "required": ["movie_title"] # Example: movie_title is always required
    }
)
In this schema 3:
type: "object" indicates the overall output will be a JSON object.
properties defines the fields within the JSON object (movie_title, release_year, actors).
Each property has a type (e.g., string, integer, array) and a description. These descriptions are vital, as they guide the LLM in populating the fields correctly from the user's prompt.1
For actors, items: {"type": "string"} specifies that it's an array of strings.
required: ["movie_title"] indicates that the movie_title field must be present in the generated JSON.
Simple examples, like a weather function requiring a location string, or more complex ones, such as a location service needing multiple address components (poi, street, city), demonstrate the versatility of this schema definition approach.43.3. Packaging FunctionDeclaration(s) with ToolThe defined FunctionDeclaration(s) are then wrapped in a Tool object. A Tool can contain multiple function declarations if the LLM should have a choice of several functions.4Python# (Illustrative Python)
movie_tool = Tool(function_declarations=[movie_info_func])
This movie_tool will be passed to the model during the generation request.43.4. Invoking the LLM: Requesting a Function CallTo instruct the LLM to use the defined tool and, ideally, to force it to attempt a function call (thereby generating the structured args JSON), the generate_content method (for single-turn requests) or chat.send_message (for multi-turn chat sessions) is used. The tools argument takes the list of Tool objects.To ensure the model attempts to produce the JSON structure, FunctionCallingConfig is employed with mode set to ANY. This configuration is passed via the generation_config parameter of the model's generation method.1Python# (Illustrative Python)
from vertexai.generative_models import GenerationConfig, ToolConfig
from vertexai.generative_models import FunctionCallingConfig as FCC_SDK # Alias for clarity

# Configure the model to always attempt a function call from the provided tools
tool_config_force_any = ToolConfig(
    function_calling_config=FCC_SDK(
        mode=FCC_SDK.Mode.ANY,
        # Optional: if multiple functions were in movie_tool,
        # this would restrict the choice to 'get_movie_details'.
        allowed_function_names=["get_movie_details"]
    )
)

# It's also good practice to set a low temperature for more predictable output
generation_config = GenerationConfig(
    temperature=0.0, # Lower temperature for less randomness
    tool_config=tool_config_force_any
)

prompt = "Can you tell me about the movie 'The Matrix Reloaded' which came out in 2003 and starred Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne?"

response = model.generate_content(
    prompt,
    tools=[movie_tool],
    generation_config=generation_config
)
The allowed_function_names parameter within FunctionCallingConfig is optional if only one function is relevant, but it becomes useful when multiple functions are declared in the tool, and a specific one is desired for a particular prompt.1 The SDK structure for ToolConfig and FunctionCallingConfig.Mode should be consistently used as per vertexai.generative_models.23.5. Retrieving and Utilizing the Structured JSON from function_call.argsAfter the LLM processes the request, its response may contain a function_call part. The structured JSON payload is located within the args field of this function_call object.2Python# (Illustrative Python)
# The model's response is a list of candidates, usually one.
# Each candidate has content, which has parts.
# The function call, if present, is in one of these parts.

if response.candidates and response.candidates.content.parts:
    function_call_part = None
    for part in response.candidates.content.parts:
        if part.function_call.name: # Check if this part is a function call
            function_call_part = part
            break

    if function_call_part and function_call_part.function_call.name == "get_movie_details":
        # The 'args' field contains the structured JSON data
        structured_json_output = dict(function_call_part.function_call.args)
        
        print("Structured JSON Output:")
        import json
        print(json.dumps(structured_json_output, indent=2))
        
        # Expected output for the example prompt:
        # {
        #   "movie_title": "The Matrix Reloaded",
        #   "release_year": 2003,
        #   "actors":
        # }
    elif response.candidates.content.parts.text:
        print("Model returned a text response instead of a function call:")
        print(response.candidates.content.parts.text)
    else:
        print("No function call or text response found as expected.")
else:
    print("No response candidates found.")

Accessing response.candidates.content.parts.function_call.args is a common pattern seen in examples.4 The args field directly provides the structured data. If the primary objective is to obtain this JSON, the process can effectively conclude here. The application has received the data in the desired machine-readable format, structured according to the FunctionDeclaration's parameters schema. This direct extraction of args simplifies the workflow considerably for use cases centered purely on structured data generation, bypassing the need for actual function execution and subsequent model calls if a final natural language summary is not required.3.6. (Optional) Completing the Loop: Executing the Function and Providing functionResponseIn a full tool-use scenario, after obtaining the function_call.args, the application would typically execute the actual function (e.g., call an external API, query a database) using these arguments.1 The result of this execution would then be packaged into a Part.from_function_response object and sent back to the LLM in a subsequent call to chat.send_message() or model.generate_content().6Python# (Illustrative Python - continuation for full loop)
# This part is executed only if you need the LLM to generate a
# natural language response based on the (simulated) function's output.

# Assume 'structured_json_output' from the previous step is available.
# 1. (Simulate) Actually call your function/API
# def get_movie_details_from_api(title, year, actors_list):
#     # In a real scenario, this would interact with a movie database
#     return {"status": "found", "rating": "8.5/10", "title": title}
#
# api_result = get_movie_details_from_api(
#     structured_json_output.get("movie_title"),
#     structured_json_output.get("release_year"),
#     structured_json_output.get("actors")
# )

# For demonstration, let's use a synthetic API response:
simulated_api_result = {
    "status": "details_fetched",
    "availability": "Available on Blu-ray and streaming.",
    "summary": f"{structured_json_output.get('movie_title')} ({structured_json_output.get('release_year')}) starring {', '.join(structured_json_output.get('actors',))} is a popular science fiction action film."
}


# 2. Send the API response back to the model
# Assuming 'chat' object for multi-turn, or use model.generate_content for single turn
# For model.generate_content, you'd construct a history of 'contents'
# For simplicity with model.generate_content, we might need to adjust the prompt or context.
# Let's assume we are in a chat context for clarity of sending function response.
# If using model.generate_content, the 'contents' list would include the initial prompt,
# the model's function call, and then this function response.

# Example with model.generate_content by providing conversation history:
# (Note: This is a simplified representation for single-turn model; chat interface is more natural for this)
# previous_parts = [
# Part.from_text(prompt), # User's initial prompt
# Part.from_dict({"function_call": response.candidates.content.parts.function_call}) # Model's function call
# ]

final_response_prompt = Part.from_function_response(
    name="get_movie_details", # Must match the name of the function called
    response={
        "content": simulated_api_result, # The actual data returned by your function
    }
)

# If using a chat model:
# chat = model.start_chat()
#... initial send_message...
#... process function call...
# final_model_response = chat.send_message(final_response_prompt)

# If using generate_content, you need to pass the conversation history:
# This requires constructing the 'contents' argument carefully.
# For simplicity, let's assume the model can take the function response directly
# to summarize, though typically it's part of a conversational history.

# A more complete generate_content call with history:
contents = [
    Part.from_text(prompt), # Original user prompt
    response.candidates.content.parts, # Model's function call response part
    final_response_prompt # Your function's result
]

final_model_response = model.generate_content(
    contents, # Pass the full conversation so far
    tools=[movie_tool], # Tools might still be relevant for further interactions
    generation_config=GenerationConfig(temperature=0.0) # Keep temperature low
)

if final_model_response.candidates and final_model_response.candidates.content.parts.text:
    print("\nLLM's final natural language response:")
    print(final_model_response.candidates.content.parts.text)
else:
    print("\nModel did not return a text response after function execution.")

The LLM then uses this external information to generate a final, enriched natural language response to the user's original query.1 However, if the sole requirement was the structured JSON from function_call.args, this entire feedback loop is unnecessary.4. Strategies for Ensuring Robust JSON OutputObtaining consistently accurate and well-structured JSON requires careful configuration and design. The following strategies are key:4.1. The Central Role of the parameters SchemaThe definition of the parameters schema within the FunctionDeclaration is the single most critical factor for successful JSON generation.3
Specify required fields: Clearly indicate which fields must be present in the output JSON using the required array within the schema definition.3 This guides the model to prioritize extracting or inferring these pieces of information.
Use precise data types: Be specific with types. For instance, use integer for whole numbers and number for floating-point values if the distinction matters.1 Use string, boolean, array, and object as appropriate.
Employ enum for restricted value sets: If a parameter can only accept a finite set of predefined values, declare it with an enum.1 This significantly constrains the model's output for that field to valid options, rather than having it try to infer or generate a value that might be incorrect. For example, {"type": "string", "enum": ["metric", "imperial"], "description": "The unit system for measurements"}.
A well-architected schema acts as a strong blueprint for the LLM.4.2. Forcing Function Calls with mode='ANY'To maximize the likelihood of receiving a JSON output, the FunctionCallingConfig.mode should be set to ANY.1 This instructs the model that it must select and attempt to provide arguments for one of the declared functions, rather than having the option to return a direct natural language response. If the prompt is designed to elicit information that maps to one of your defined function schemas, this mode is the most reliable way to ensure the model produces the args JSON structure.4.3. Crafting Effective Function and Parameter DescriptionsThe natural language description fields for both the FunctionDeclaration itself and each of its parameters play a crucial role in guiding the LLM's behavior.1 These descriptions are not merely comments; they are actively used by the model to:
Decide which function to "call": The function's main description helps the model determine if that function is relevant to the user's query.1
Understand how to populate the JSON fields: The description for each parameter tells the model what kind of information it should look for in the user's prompt to fill that specific field in the args JSON.
Therefore, these descriptions act as targeted "soft prompts" or instructions embedded within the tool definition. Vague or misleading descriptions can lead to the model choosing an inappropriate function, failing to extract necessary data, or populating the JSON fields incorrectly. Conversely, clear, verbose, and unambiguous descriptions significantly improve the accuracy and completeness of the generated JSON. For instance, instead of a parameter description like "User location," a more effective one would be "The city and state, or zip code of the user's current location, e.g., 'San Francisco, CA' or '94107'." This level of detail provides better guidance to the LLM. It is an investment in clarity that pays dividends in the quality of the structured output.4.4. Managing Model temperature for PredictabilityThe temperature parameter in GenerationConfig controls the randomness of the LLM's output. For tasks requiring predictable and factual output, such as generating structured JSON, a low temperature (e.g., 0.0 or a very small value like 0.1) is highly recommended.1 Higher temperatures introduce more creativity and variability, which can be detrimental when a consistent JSON structure and accurate data extraction are paramount. A low temperature encourages the model to select the most probable tokens, leading to more deterministic and often more accurate mapping of prompt information to the JSON schema, reducing the chance of "hallucinated" or irrelevant field values.15. Advanced Techniques and ConsiderationsBeyond the basics, several advanced techniques can refine the process of obtaining structured JSON.5.1. Handling Scenarios Requiring Multiple Structured Outputs (Parallel Function Calls)For user prompts that inherently request multiple distinct pieces of information, each potentially mapping to a different function or requiring separate structured outputs, the Gemini models can propose several function calls in parallel within a single response turn.1 If mode is ANY and the prompt implies multiple actions or data extractions covered by different function declarations, the model might return a list of functionCall objects in its response.The application would then iterate through these functionCall objects, extracting the args JSON from each. If the goal is solely to obtain these multiple JSON objects, this capability is directly supported. If the broader tool-use pattern is being followed (where functions are executed and results fed back), all API responses from these parallel calls should be provided back to the model, typically in the same order as the calls were proposed.1 This allows the model to synthesize all gathered information for its final response.5.2. Restricting Model Choices with allowed_function_namesWhen multiple FunctionDeclarations are provided within a Tool (or across multiple tools), and FunctionCallingConfig.mode is set to ANY, the allowed_function_names parameter offers finer-grained control.1 By specifying a list of function names in allowed_function_names, the developer can restrict the model to choose only from that subset, even if other functions are technically available in the tools.2This is particularly useful in scenarios where the application logic, based on the current context or user input, already knows which specific JSON structure (and thus which function) is most appropriate. It prevents the model from erroneously selecting a less relevant function, thereby increasing the predictability of the output JSON structure. For example, if a user is in a "movie search" part of an application, allowed_function_names could be set to ["get_movie_details"], even if a get_weather_forecast function is also defined globally.6. Best Practices for Vertex AI Function Calling for JSON OutputAdhering to best practices will enhance the reliability and maintainability of systems designed to extract structured JSON using Vertex AI function calling.6.1. Designing Clear and Unambiguous Function DeclarationsThe clarity of FunctionDeclarations is paramount.
Distinct Names: Use unique and descriptive names for each function.
Comprehensive Descriptions: Write detailed descriptions for the function's overall purpose and for each parameter. Ensure the function's purpose directly aligns with the intended JSON output structure.1 For example, a function named extract_contact_info should have a description clearly stating it extracts name, email, and phone number, and its parameters should reflect this.
6.2. Schema Best PracticesThe parameters schema is the blueprint for your JSON.
Specific Data Types: Use the most precise data type (e.g., INTEGER for whole numbers, NUMBER for decimals, BOOLEAN for true/false).1
Enums for Fixed Sets: Leverage enum for parameters that have a known, finite set of valid values.1 This greatly reduces errors.
Define required Properties: Clearly mark essential fields as required in your schema.3
Simplicity: Keep schemas as simple as possible while still capturing the necessary structure. Overly complex or deeply nested schemas might be harder for the LLM to populate accurately.
OpenAPI Limitations: Be aware of any limitations in Vertex AI's support for the OpenAPI schema. For example, attributes like default or oneOf might not be supported as indicated in some contexts 8, so designs should rely on supported attributes like type, nullable, required, format, description, properties, items, and enum.1
It is often an iterative process to arrive at the optimal schema and descriptions. Initial attempts might not yield perfect JSON. Developers should anticipate a cycle of defining a schema, testing with various prompts, observing the LLM's output, and then refining the FunctionDeclaration (both schema and descriptions) to better guide the model. This is akin to prompt engineering but applied to the structured definition of tools, where adjustments are made to the tool's "contract" with the LLM.6.3. Validating functionCall.args (Client-Side)While the LLM endeavors to adhere to the provided schema when generating functionCall.args, it is a best practice to implement client-side validation of the received JSON. This is especially important if the JSON is used in critical downstream processes or to trigger further actions. Standard JSON schema validation libraries can be used to verify that the args object conforms to the expected structure and data types before it is consumed by other parts of the application. This adds a layer of robustness against unexpected model outputs.6.4. Prompt Engineering for Function CallingEven with the structured guidance of function calling, the quality of the initial user prompt still significantly influences the outcome. The prompt should:
Provide sufficient context for the LLM to understand the user's intent.
Contain the necessary information that the LLM needs to extract and map to the JSON fields.
Be phrased in a way that naturally aligns with the purpose of one of the defined functions.
As recommended, prepending the user prompt with additional context, instructions on how and when to use functions, and guidance to ask clarifying questions if the query is ambiguous can improve the model's ability to select the correct function and populate its arguments accurately.16.5. Brief Note on Pricing and Error Handling Context
Pricing: Interactions involving function calling, including the input (prompt, function declarations, conversation history) and output (generated functionCall objects, text responses), are typically billed based on the number of characters.1 Conversation history can be truncated by Vertex AI (e.g., at 32,000 characters) which might affect long-running conversations.
Error Handling: Standard API error handling practices apply. This includes managing network issues, authentication problems, and quota limits (e.g., RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED with HTTP code 429).9 Specific to function calling, errors might arise if schemas are malformed or if the model, even when forced with mode='ANY', cannot reasonably map an ambiguous prompt to any defined function's parameters. Reviewing API error responses and logs is crucial for debugging.9
Achieving reliable structured JSON output is a result of the effective interplay between a well-crafted user prompt, clear and accurate FunctionDeclarations (including their schemas and descriptions), and appropriate FunctionCallingConfig settings (particularly mode='ANY'). A deficiency in any of these components can lead to suboptimal results. Therefore, a holistic approach that considers how these elements interact is essential for success.7. Conclusion: Mastering Structured Output with Vertex AIVertex AI's function calling mechanism provides a robust and flexible pathway for developers to obtain structured JSON data from Large Language Models. By carefully defining FunctionDeclarations with precise parameters schemas, crafting clear and guiding descriptions, and strategically using FunctionCallingConfig (especially mode='ANY'), LLMs can be effectively directed to transform natural language queries into machine-readable JSON objects. The functionCall.args field in the model's response directly delivers this structured payload, streamlining integration with downstream systems.The key takeaways for developers include the paramount importance of the schema definition, the utility of detailed descriptions as "soft prompts" for the LLM, and the power of mode='ANY' in conjunction with a low temperature for ensuring predictable JSON output. The process is often iterative, requiring refinement of function declarations based on observed model behavior.For further exploration, developers are encouraged to experiment with more complex and nested JSON schemas, investigate parallel function calls for multifaceted queries, and explore the full potential of multi-turn chat interactions where the results from actual function executions are fed back to the model for even more sophisticated and context-aware responses. The official Google Cloud Vertex AI documentation and associated Colab notebooks remain invaluable resources for continued learning and practical application.4 By mastering these techniques, developers can unlock new possibilities for building intelligent applications that seamlessly bridge the gap between human language and structured data.
